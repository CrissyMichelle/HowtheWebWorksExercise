    <h1>How the Web Works Exercise</h1>
    <h2>Part One: Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is the standard convention for web browser-to-server communications.</li>
        <li>URL stands for Universal Resource Locator and contains information necessary for rendering webpage content.</li>
        <li>DNS stands for Domain Name Server and is the server your router will go to when it needs help locating an IP address.</li>
        <li>A query string, found at the end of a URL, requests extra information from the website by specifiying values for certain pre-defined paramters.</li>
        <li>The two HTTPS methods or 'verbs' focused on so far are GET and POST.  Both are requests but GET doesn't involve any side effects or impacts to the 
            website's data.  POST does involve side effects.
        </li>
        <li>An HTTP request is what happens when your browser seeks to render a webpage.</li>
        <li>An HTTP response is what is returned in consequence of an HTTP request.  Both events consist of header information.</li>
        <li>An HTTP header is the first part of a request or response and consists of metadata.  Examples of header data I have seen include response codes and date/time info.</li>
        <li>The processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html”  into your browser include requests and responses.
            First your computer searches the local cache, asks the router, and if still nothing matching the hostname is found, reaches out to the DNS.  Eventually
            either a 404 response if returned or the IP address of somesite.com is located and your browser can start assembling the different components necessary for 
            rendering the fully completed HTML content.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part Two: Practice Tools</h2>
    <h3>I think the following goes into Terminal...</h3>
    <p>Using <b><i>curl</i></b> to make a <b><i>GET</i></b> request for all the dad jokes involving the word "pirate":</p>
    <p>% curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"<br>
        {"current_page":1,"limit":20,"next_page":1,"previous_page":1,"results":[{"id":"2gii3LeN7Ed","joke":"Why couldn't the kid see the pirate movie? Because it was rated arrr!"},
        {"id":"QuscibaMClb","joke":"What does a pirate pay for his corn? A buccaneer!"},{"id":"SvzIBAQS0Dd","joke":"What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? Aye Matey!"},
        {"id":"exXSCtkOKe","joke":"Why do pirates not know the alphabet? They always get stuck at \"C\"."},{"id":"SnOf2gqjiqc","joke":"Why are pirates called pirates? Because they arrr!"}],
        "search_term":"pirate","status":200,"total_jokes":5,"total_pages":1}</p><br>
    <p>Using <b><i>dig</i></b> to find out the IP address of <i>icanhazdadjoke.com</i>:</p>
    <p>% dig icanhazdadjoke.com A +noall +answer</p><br>
    <p>; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> icanhazdadjoke.com A +noall +answer
        ;; global options: +cmd
        icanhazdadjoke.com.	300	IN	A	104.21.66.15
        icanhazdadjoke.com.	300	IN	A	172.67.198.173</p><br>
    <p>I made a "simple" webpage that actually took me many hours to figure out.  Using Terminal and Python to view the page in my browser:</p>
    <p>% cd Desktop</p>
    <p>% cd JeopardyProject</p>
    <p>% python3 -m http.server</p><br>
    <p>Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
        ::1 - - [30/Apr/2023 12:12:55] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 -
        ::1 - - [30/Apr/2023 12:12:55] "GET /style.css HTTP/1.1" 304 -
        ::1 - - [30/Apr/2023 12:12:55] "GET /app.js HTTP/1.1" 304 -
        ::1 - - [30/Apr/2023 12:12:55] code 404, message File not found
        ::1 - - [30/Apr/2023 12:12:55] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -</p>
    <p>Four GET requests happened in less than a second!</p>
    <h3>Part Three: Explore Dev Tools</h3>
    <form action=`https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+money+does+a+lawyer+make+in+tampa" method="GET">
        <p><label for="city">Desired City of Residence:</label></p>
        <input type="text" id="place">
        <p><label for="job">Desired Occupation:</label></p>
        <input type="text" id="work">
        <p><button>Submit</button></p>
    </form>
    <!-- <script>const work = document.getElementById("work").value;const place = document.getElementById("place").value;
    console.log(`I do ${work} in ${place}`);</script> -->
</body>
